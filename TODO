System overview
CPU vs. FSM
Bus protocol
Memory  IMEM DMEM REG
UART
GPIO
Timer
Debug:   Status registers  logic analyzer buffer?  Heartbeat
Clocking

For delivery:
    R/W peripheral REG over bus
    Print over UART
    Toggle GPIO & read switches
    Run simple program or sequencer that exercises peripherals
    Produce address map + Block Diagram + timing notes

After SoC
    DFT infrastructure (Scan BIST hooks)
    Test Controller
    Fault injection +coverage reporting
